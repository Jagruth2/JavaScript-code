# JavaScript-code
I have made the code  that replicates the google analytics

This is done with the help of aws as well.
Use your aws credentials and region.
Use Identity pool credentials.
Don't forget to create Dynamodb database in the same region
Use S3 bucket to store this js file  and create a link.
Just paste this link in any of your website as a source for js script.

You will then recieve what ever user clicks and typed in your webiste to your dynamoDB database.
